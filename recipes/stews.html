    <p>There are two types of carrots found in Hyrule: Swift Carrots and Endura Carrots. Both make excellent stews.</p>
    <p>Swift carrots are grown in the towns so they are pretty abundant. Most carrot stew that you'll find is made from
        these</p>
    <p>Endura carrots have to be harvested in the wild. Typically they are foraged around Satori Mountain.</p>
