# Odin Recipes

A simple website containing a few recipes.

Completing this project gives me a chance to practice HTML tags learned during the course. The following tags will be used

- \<img> image tag. use 'src' attribute for the source of the image and 'alt' tag for alternate text used by screen readers
- \<a> anchor tag. Used to link pages on a website. Use the'href' attribute to provide the path to the new page
- \<h1> header tag. used to mark text as a heading (for a page, section, subsection, etc.)
- \<p> paragraph tag. This is used to mark shape text into paragraphs.
- \<ul> onordered list. Wraps list items to display as an unordered list.
- \<li> list item. This is put inside a \<ul> or \<ol> tag to mark a list item.
